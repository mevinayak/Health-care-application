In most of the developing countries, people ignore the fundamental health-related information such as BMI, Nutrition level in their body, Body’s total blood volume and also, they are careless during the pandemic situation. The solution to overcome this issue is by developing mobile applications as smartphone users have increased drastically and crossed billions. Body Mass Index (BMI) is basically an estimation of an individual’s body mass with respect to his/her height. It is a very common term for those who care about their well-being. It is more of an indicator than an immediate estimation of the body-fat ratio. Most of the BMI calculators that are available online only shows the calculation but don’t provide dietary guidance, which is one of the most important aspects. The main objective is to design an application that gives dietary and nutrition guidance not only on the basis of BMI but also on the basis of nutrition level. Blood volume can also be calculated, and the user can even check the global status of COVID-19 with some helpful tips to fight the pandemic.
